## WhatsApp Message Scheduler
This project sends WhatsApp messages using WhatsApp Web automation via the
pywhatkit library. It is intended strictly for educational purposes.

WhatsApp does not provide an official API for personal accounts. As such,
this project requires the user to be logged into WhatsApp Web and may open
a browser window when sending messages.
